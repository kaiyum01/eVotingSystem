Project: eVoting System
-------

This project developed by me when I was (2016) a student of university. I developed it as for my university final defence project. 

=> You create some of admins and set permission of access.
=> Then admin set primary data of voters. 
=> Then admin set some date such as voter registration dateline,candidate registration dateline and result publication dateline.
=> Then voters can easily register with their valuable information. Also create voter personal Profile with Unique ID and Password
=> Every voter and candidate must be email verified
=> Then candidates also create thier profile with valuable information.
=> then Admin check all candidates and voters profile. Admin have access of aprove/unapprove every voter and candidate.
=> Then every candidate and voter can see their approval status by login their own profile.
=> Unapprove candidates and voters can not join this process/system
=> Every voter gives vote by login their own profile
=> Giving vote process blocked after giving one time vote. I mean every voter can give only one vote.
=> After giving vote before dateline then system calculate autmatically total votes per candidate.
=> Then admin just controll result publication (Show/Hide) but admin can not access manually to increase/disincrease vote.
=> Finally every one can see the total vote casting, total voter per candidate and Ranking of candidate.
